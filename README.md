# OSHCamp - Wuthering Bytes, 2023 - MicroPython

This repository contains the MicroPython talk materials - slides in both Keynote and PDF
formats, the PDF of the course notes, and the Python code to go with each experiment in
the course (including a number of libraries).

Steve will also have this material on a USB drive if the gods of the Internet are
against us.

Don't forget to let me know about any ideas you have for improvements to the code!
